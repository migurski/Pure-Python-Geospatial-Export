- This is a Python project
- Expect that a virtualenv .venv directory already exists and use it when it does
- The ppge module and requirements are described in pyproject.toml
- When we run tests in this project, we use the unittest module with this command: `python -m unittest ppge-tests/test-*.py`
- The project linter is ruff, new commits should always pass lint:
    - `python -m ruff check ppge/*.py ppge-tests/*.py`
    - `python -m ruff format ppge/*.py ppge-tests/*.py`
